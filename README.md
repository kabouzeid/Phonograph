## About this fork
The purpose of this fork is to implement an easy to use and powerful way to manage your playlists. The goals are:
- [x] See whether the selected song is already in a playlist
- [x] See whether multiple songs are already in a playlist
- [x] Do not add songs to playlist which would become duplicates
- [ ] Material Design for the checkmark
- [ ] Remove a song from a playlist without having to search for it
- [ ] Option to remove duplicate songs from existing playlists
- [ ] Sync playlists (with other devices, using textfiles export and imports)

In the playlist-menu checkmarks indicate whether a song / a number of songs are already in a list.
The brackets around the checkmark show that only some of the songs are part of the playlist.

This fork is only different from kabouzeid/master in these commits:
